# Review Tracker Skill

You are helping the user review tracker progress and generate status reports. This skill analyzes the tracker, calculates statistics, identifies bottlenecks, and provides actionable insights.

## Your Task

Read the tracker, analyze progress, and present a comprehensive report with completion status, pending tasks, blockers, and recommendations.

## Process Flow

### Step 1: Parse Arguments and Find Tracker

1. **Parse `$ARGUMENTS`** for:
   - Tracker name (first argument)
   - Optional flags:
     - `--detailed` - Show detailed breakdown of all tasks
     - `--phase=N` - Filter by specific phase
     - `--track=name` - Filter by specific track
     - `--status=value` - Filter by status (Pending/In Progress/Complete/Blocked)
     - `--export` - Export report to file

2. **If tracker name not provided**:
   - List available trackers:
     ```bash
     ls -1 .trackers/
     ```
   - If no trackers exist:
     * Inform user: "No trackers found. Create one with /create-tracker"
     * Exit
   - If trackers exist:
     * Show list to user with basic stats
     * Ask: "Which tracker would you like to review?"
     * Wait for response

3. **Verify tracker exists**:
   - Check if `.trackers/{TRACKER_NAME}/TRACKER.md` exists
   - If not found:
     * Inform user: "Tracker '{TRACKER_NAME}' not found"
     * Exit

4. **Read the tracker file**:
   - Use Read tool on `.trackers/{TRACKER_NAME}/TRACKER.md`

### Step 2: Parse and Analyze Tracker

1. **Extract metadata**:
   - Tracker name
   - Created date
   - Last updated date
   - Overall status

2. **Parse phases**:
   - For each phase, extract:
     * Phase number and name
     * Phase status
     * Start and completion dates
     * List of tracks in this phase
     * List of tasks in this phase

3. **Parse tracks**:
   - For each track, extract:
     * Track name
     * Phase coverage
     * Track status
     * Task count and completion ratio

4. **Parse tasks**:
   - For each task, extract:
     * Task number
     * Title
     * Phase
     * Track
     * Status
     * Priority
     * Complexity
     * Blocked by (dependencies)
     * Started and completed dates
     * Plan file reference

5. **Calculate statistics**:

   a. **Overall stats**:
      - Total tasks
      - Tasks by status (Pending, In Progress, Complete, Blocked, On Hold, Cancelled)
      - Completion percentage
      - Average task complexity

   b. **Per-phase stats**:
      - Tasks per phase
      - Completion ratio per phase
      - Phase status

   c. **Per-track stats**:
      - Tasks per track
      - Completion ratio per track
      - Track status

   d. **Priority breakdown**:
      - High priority tasks (total, pending, complete)
      - Medium priority tasks
      - Low priority tasks

   e. **Blocked tasks**:
      - Count of blocked tasks
      - List of blockers
      - Identify circular dependencies

### Step 3: Identify Issues and Blockers

1. **Find blocking tasks**:
   - List all tasks with status "Blocked"
   - For each blocked task:
     * Identify what it's blocked by
     * Check if blocking tasks are complete
     * Calculate how many tasks are blocked by each blocker

2. **Find critical path**:
   - Identify high-priority tasks that are blocked
   - Find tasks blocking multiple other tasks
   - Calculate dependency chains

3. **Find stalled work**:
   - Tasks "In Progress" for extended periods (if timestamps available)
   - Phases with no recent progress

4. **Find risks**:
   - High number of pending high-priority tasks
   - Many blocked tasks
   - Phases with low completion rates

### Step 4: Generate Report

Based on flags, generate appropriate report:

#### Default Report (Summary View)

```markdown
# Tracker Review: {TRACKER_NAME}

**Generated**: {CURRENT_DATE}
**Last Updated**: {TRACKER_UPDATED_DATE}
**Status**: {TRACKER_STATUS}

## Overview

{END_FOR_EACH_TASK}
{END_FOR_EACH_TRACK}
{END_FOR_EACH_PHASE}
```

#### Filtered Reports

**By Phase** (`--phase=N`):
- Show only tasks in specified phase
- Phase-specific statistics
- Track progress within that phase

**By Track** (`--track=name`):
- Show only tasks in specified track
- Track progress across all phases
- Track-specific timeline

**By Status** (`--status=value`):
- Show only tasks with specified status
- Useful for "what's blocked?", "what's pending?", etc.

### Step 5: Generate Dynamic Recommendations

Based on analysis, provide actionable recommendations:

1. **If many blocked tasks**:
   ```
   ⚠️ {COUNT} tasks are blocked. Focus on:
   - Task {N}: {TITLE} (blocks {COUNT} other tasks)
   - Task {M}: {TITLE} (blocks {COUNT} other tasks)
   ```

2. **If phase has low completion**:
   ```
   📊 Phase {N} is {PERCENTAGE}% complete. Consider:
   - Focusing resources on this phase
   - Breaking down complex tasks
   - Reviewing phase scope
   ```

3. **If high-priority tasks pending**:
   ```
   🔴 {COUNT} high-priority tasks are pending:
   - Prioritize Task {N}: {TITLE}
   - Prioritize Task {M}: {TITLE}
   ```

4. **If near completion**:
   ```
   🎉 Almost done! {PERCENTAGE}% complete.
   - {COUNT} tasks remaining
   - Focus on: {LIST_REMAINING}
   ```

5. **If stalled progress** (tasks in progress for long time):
   ```
   ⏱️ Some tasks may be stalled:
   - Task {N}: {TITLE} (in progress since {DATE})
   - Consider updating status or adding help
   ```

6. **If circular dependencies**:
   ```
   🔄 Circular dependency detected:
   - Task {N} blocked by Task {M}
   - Task {M} blocked by Task {N}
   - Resolve dependencies
   ```

7. **If no blockers**:
   ```
   ✓ Good progress! No blocking issues.
   - {COUNT} tasks ready to start
   - {COUNT} tasks in progress
   ```

### Step 6: Export Report (if --export flag)

If user requested export:

1. **Generate filename**:
   - Format: `{TRACKER_NAME}-review-{DATE}.md`
   - Example: `my-app-review-2026-01-27.md`

2. **Save report** to `.trackers/{TRACKER_NAME}/reviews/{FILENAME}`
   - Create `reviews/` directory if needed
   - Write full report to file

3. **Inform user**:
   ```
   Report exported to: .trackers/{TRACKER_NAME}/reviews/{FILENAME}
   ```

### Step 7: Present Report to User

Display the generated report to the user.

If not exported, display in terminal.

Add footer:

```
---

**Commands**:
- Update task: /update-tracker {TRACKER_NAME} --task={N}
- Add task: /add-task {TRACKER_NAME}
- Review again: /review-tracker {TRACKER_NAME}
- Export report: /review-tracker {TRACKER_NAME} --export

Tracker location: .trackers/{TRACKER_NAME}/TRACKER.md
```

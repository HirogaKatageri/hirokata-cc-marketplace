# Phase 3: Services - hello-world

**Phase Number**: 3
**Status**: Pending
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 (Models)

## Phase Overview

No tasks have been identified for this phase in the current master plan.

## Implementation Context

This phase typically includes external API integrations, third-party service clients, and network communication layers. The Hello World Python program does not require any external service integrations as it's a self-contained, offline application that only outputs to the console.

Services phase would include:
- REST/GraphQL API clients
- Third-party service integrations
- HTTP communication layers
- Authentication service clients
- Payment service integrations
- Email/SMS service wrappers

For future enhancements, this phase could include:
- A web API endpoint to serve the greeting
- Integration with a translation service for i18n
- Logging service integration

## Phase Completion Checklist

- [ ] Phase marked as complete (no tasks to implement)
- [ ] Ready to proceed to Phase 4

## Notes

This phase will be skipped during implementation as no tasks are currently planned.

**Why No Services?**:
The Hello World program is intentionally simple and self-contained. It doesn't need to communicate with external services, make API calls, or integrate with third-party systems.

**When Would This Phase Be Needed?**:
If the project were extended to include:
- Web API version (Flask/FastAPI endpoint)
- Translation service integration
- Remote logging service
- Cloud deployment with external monitoring

Then this phase would include tasks for those service integrations.
